to get frontend working: 
1.) you should use the cd command to get to the frontend folder, cd frontend

2.) then install all dependencies from packages.json by typing, npm install

3.) now that you've done that you can now run the local server with, npm start

to get backend working:
1.) you should use the cd command to get to the backend folder, cd backend

2.) once you are in the backend folder we need to enter the python virtual environment
    to do this you have to open a command prompt instead of a powershell. At the bottom of your
    vscode there is a terminal window if you look at the top right of that terminal if it says powershell
    you need to click the down arrow next to the + sign and select command prompt, once you've done that
    make sure you are in the backend folder in that command prompt. If you are then you can run this command now, env\Scripts\activate
    now you should see a (env) at the start of your command line that means you are good to good

3.) now that we are in a virtual env we can return back to the backend folder using, cd ..
    and we can install our dependencies using, pip install -r requirements.txt

4.) now that we are in a virtual env and we have installed our requirements we can run the local server by doing, cd kanga
    then, python manage.py runserver

    note: my laptop worked using, py manage.py runserver, so try both
